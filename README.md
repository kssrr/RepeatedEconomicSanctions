# "Overuse" of Economic Sanctions - Does Repeated Imposition of Economic Sanctions Hurt Their Effectiveness?

*BA-thesis project.* 

**Abstract.** Does the repeated imposition of economic sanctions make them less effective? While conventional wisdom in the scholarly and public debate seems to suggest so, there is little empirical evidence: we lack an understanding of how "overusing" economic sanctions affects their ability to extract policy concessions. I address this by examining whether the number of prior sanctions imposed by the same sender on the same target affects the effectiveness of newly imposed sanctions, drawing on the "Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions" data set to study the relationship. Using a fixed-effects approach to examine the relationship within sender-target dyads in an unbalanced panel, I observe negative effects, suggesting that sanctions become less effective when used repeatedly by the same sender against the same target. The results are, however, subject to particularizations. First, they depend on the operationalization of success. Second, the effect is hard to distinguish from potentially interfering unobserved trends in the time dimension. Third, the effect is largely driven by a handful of dyads with a very high number of sanctions, and the United States' frequent use of economic sanctions. While the findings are thus nowhere near conclusive, they do nevertheless offer circumstantial evidence that using sanctions too frequently may hurt their effectiveness.
